NAME
    RT-Action-AssignUnownedToActor - Assigns unowned tickets to the
    transaction actor

DESCRIPTION
    Assigns tickets to the actor of the transaction that triggered the
    scrip, if all the conditions below are met:

    The ticket is owned by Nobody
    The actor isn't RT_System
    The actor isn't a requestor on the ticket
    The actor has the right to own the ticket

    Note that this means the requestor will never be assigned as the owner
    by this action.

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

        Only run this once or you'll end up with duplicate scrip actions.

        Add this line:

            Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Action::AssignUnownedToActor));

        or add "RT::Action::AssignUnownedToActor" to your existing @Plugins
        line.
